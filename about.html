        below is a comment section.  please, try you're best not to cyberbully each other!!!! i would like to think that this is a less regulated version of what goes on in the forest scout comment sections.  meaning, by all means, bully the theater kids and you know who else. it's like a democratized version of twitter!!!!! (but if you mail me $20 i will absolutely make you verified).

        this is a work in progress but i'm taking a break to spend time with my dying brother up in the labrador penninsula so the comments only work locally (on your own brower) and the reply function is so-so. the reason it looks so bad is because i couldn't design between a comment section thing and a chat function thing so i decided on both.  you may have a conversation with yourself and enjoy schizophrenia for a bit! or perhaps type in fake names and ensure you're friend doesn't go to college! the possibilities are endless!
