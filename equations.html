        <br>
        i love this one!!! i use it when i'm trying to find the final velocity at the end of a trip.  this one is very simple, but it doesn't tell us anything about position so it gets second place among the kinematics.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px;">\(x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac {1}{2} at^2\)</div>
        <br>
        this one is excellent.  it covers all the bases, assuming that acceleration is constant.  since acceleration is usually constant, this one is a win!!! it's also very helpful with free fall or projectile motion, since we know that a = 9.81, and the initial velocity is either give or 0.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px;">\(v^2 = (v_0)^2 + 2a(x - x_0)\)</div>
        <br>
        this one is good for when you are trying to find out the braking distance.  at least, that's the only time i've ever used it.  not a fan of this one othewise.

        <br>
        ah yes. an all around classic.  either the object is accelerating, and the <em>magnitude</em> of the forces add up to some scalar, or the accleration is zero, and the <em>magnitudes</em> of the forces all add up to zero.  either way this one is very important and i love it.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px;">\(F_{net} = F_1 + F_2 ... F_n\)</div>
        <br>
        this is an extension of the previous equation.  we know that the net force, which is a scalar, is the same as all of the other forces added up.  if they don't all add up to zero that means that the object is accelerating.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px;">\(f = \mu N\)</div>
        <br>
        friction is in fact fun!!!! but not when i don't remember which normal force this equation is referring to.  it's the one that's pushing upwards from the floor to the surface.  this is <b>only</b> for kinetic friction.  in order to calculate static friciton, you must use newton's second law.

    <div class="blog">
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px">\(W = Fdcos \theta = \Delta KE\)</div>
        <br>
        i like the energy part of this equation, but the \(Fdcos \theta\) part confuses me.  what's theta?? is it x displacement or total displacement??? what's the force, net force??? ugh.
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px">\(KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\)</div>
        <br>
        i like this equation. \(\frac{1}{2}xy^2\) is such a real one in the world of physics, problably because it's the integral of x multiplied by some fundamental constant. who knows how it work?? not me.
       <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px">\(U = mgh\)</div>
        <br>
        this one is one of my favorites!!! it's so easy, and it makes perfect sense.  potential energy is reliant on mass, gravity, and height.  the energy equations are truly perfect.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle" style="font-size: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px">\(F_{c} = \frac{mv^2}{r}\)</div>
        <br>
        this one can be confusing but it's just important to remember that centripetal force is not actually a force, it's the sum of the forces in the centripetal direction. sometimes this is normal force, sometimes it's weight + normal force, sometimes it's friction, but \(F_{c}\) is not acutally something that goes in the force diagram.
