        <div class="movieTitle"><u>engr 145: chemistry of materials</u></div>
        <br>
        this class was a joke.  i showed up to all of the lectures and did other stuff on my laptop.  i do not know any of the material that we were supposed to learn.  on the first and third test, i got a 99%, because they were open internet.  the second test was also open internet but a different story, i didn't do too hot.  and the final, which was a video presentation, never got graded, meaning that i somehow skated by with a 90 in the class despite not learning a single thing.  W class, but not if you actually intend on being an engineer.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>csds 233: data structures</u></div>
        <br>
        this class was so fun!!! the entire thing is made up of six programming assignments, the midterm, and the final.  the programming assignment were so much fun, i did them all the second that they were assigned which is a bit embarassing to admit but no one goes on this website anyways.  it was just writing each data strucutre, which is pretty standard for a data structures class.  sorting kinda tripped me up but that's okay, not everyone is good at sorting.  the lectures were not really worth going to, especially the first quarter where it was just queues and stacks (how many ways are there to say that a queue is a deck of cards and a stack is a line of students?!).  we got a 8.5x11 cheat sheat on the midterm, and two of those on the final, but they weren't really necessary.  definetly a good class.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>math 122: calculus ii</u></div>
        <br>
        chris is god tier.  there is no way that this is the same calc ii that i learned sophomore year of high school because this was fine and the high school math not so much.  pretty much anyone who does what is asked of them can get an A in this class, he makes it very clear what is expected and releases the past decade of previous tests which are basically the same each year.  it's a very systematic class which is good for an intro level calc class with 200+ people.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>sages: women and leadership</u></div>
        <br>
        i have no complaints for this class.  the first, fourth, and fifth essays are graded on completion (although they are a lower percentage of the grade overall), so even though i did really badly on the second one, i still managed to do well in the class.  it was defintely pretty chill, we had reading due each class that i never completed, but i still got all my participation points by adding on to what other people were saying.  highly recommend if you want an easy sages class.
